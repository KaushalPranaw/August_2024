The Bridge Design Pattern in Java helps separate (or "decouple") two parts of a system that can vary independently. It is like building a bridge between two parts to make them work together without being tightly connected. Letâ€™s break it down in layman terms.

Analogy: Remote Control and Devices
Imagine you have different types of remote controls (basic remote, smart remote) and different types of devices (TV, radio, air conditioner). Instead of creating a separate remote control for each device, you can create a universal remote that works with any device. This way, you can mix and match remotes and devices.

For example:

A basic remote can work with a TV or a radio.
A smart remote can also work with a TV or a radio.
Instead of designing a separate basic TV remote and smart TV remote, you design remotes and devices separately and connect them using a bridge.

Structure of the Bridge Pattern
In the Bridge Pattern, you typically have:

**Abstraction**: Represents the high-level interface (like a remote control).
**Implementor**: Represents the low-level interface (like the device being controlled).
**Concrete Abstraction**: Specific types of remote controls.
**Concrete Implementor**: Specific types of devices.
